# Mobile-Architecture-and-Programming

# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

For this project we were asked to develop and fully launch a mobile application. I selected and inventory application that had a user login screen, create user screen, and main screen. I developed code that allows a user to log in. Developed code to create a database shell and display that database’s information on a user’s screen using a grid. Develop code that prompts users for permission to send SMS messaging notifications and makes the app function based on the individual user's response.

# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

I developed code that allows a user to log in. Developed code to create a database shell and display that database’s information on a user’s screen using a grid. Develop code that prompts users for permission to send SMS messaging notifications and makes the app function based on the individual user's response.

# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I first started to overcomplicate the look of the app before making sure that it worked correctly. After I stopped and went back to make sure the correct things were being accomplished, I was able to create this mobile application.

# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I ran multiple tests on the emulator inside Android Studio to see how the code was working. I also took advantage of the debugger to see where things were not working as expected. 

# Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

One challenge that I had to overcome in the developmental process was implementing the update and remove elements of the items. I did many tests to see where I was not getting the expected outputs and was able to successfully complete these components.
